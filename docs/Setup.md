The Apple GameCenter extension is to be used alongside your Apple Developer account ([App Store Connect webpage](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)). All the required personal leaderboard ids and achievement ids should be managed from there.

1. For creating leaderboards follow this guide: [Adding Leaderboards](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/configure-leaderboards)
2. For creating achievements follow the guide: [Adding Achievements](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/configure-game-center/configure-achievements)
3. If you intend to use ${module.savedgames} functionality you need to create a new iCloud container using your Apple developer account dashboard ([dashboard link](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard/)).

	<array>
		<string>iCloud.${YYBundleIdentifier}</string>
	</array>

	<key>com.apple.developer.icloud-services</key>
